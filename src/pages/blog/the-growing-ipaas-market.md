The market for embedded integration platform as a service (IPaaS) solutions is exploding lately. Exciting new entrants like Merge, Hotglue, Finch, and Allow Automation are gaining traction across industries. However, much of this new wave of embedded IPaaS tools are closed source platforms.

As the ecosystem matures and becomes saturated, these closed source vendors could potentially struggle to compete against open source alternatives that build with transparency, flexibility, developer trust, and innovation velocity.

### The Rise of Embedded iPaaS

First, what exactly is embedded iPaaS? Essentially, embedded integration platforms are tools that allow developers to build connectivity to data sources, APIs, and applications directly into their software applications and products via integrations and APIs.

This means any app or service can now easily ingest and orchestrate data from diverse systems to create seamless workflows and unified customer experiences.

Embedded iPaaS has become red hot because every modern digital product needs integrations to various databases, services, identity providers, payment systems, and more. Building and maintaining all these connections in-house is time-consuming and expensive.

That's where embedded iPaaS comes in - giving developers simple self-service tools to quickly connect their apps to all needed data sources and capabilities via pre-built connectors and APIs.

The ability to easily "snap in" integrations and data flows programmatically is extremely empowering. It allows products to interoperate and exchange data seamlessly.

So demand for embedded iPaaS solutions that abstract away the complexity of integrations is skyrocketing. Organizations want to focus dev resources on their core products rather than building their own integrations infrastructure.

### The Growing Market of Closed Source Players

Given the need, we are now seeing an avalanche of embedded iPaaS solutions flooding the market.  Platforms like Merge, Hotglue, Finch, and Alloy are gaining fast adoption as drop in solutions for third-party integrations. 

However, much of this new generation relies on closed proprietary code and restrictive licensing models. The problem with these closed source embedded iPaaS platforms is the lack of transparency into how the software operates behind the scenes. Developers can't inspect or customize core logic.

Closed models also limit extending the platforms. Adopters must accept whatever functionality the vendor decides to build and release. Adding new data sources is restricted.

Initially, these constraints seem an acceptable compromise for simplicity. But as the market saturates, closed limitations will frustrate adopters more and more over time.

### The Looming Struggles for Closed Source Vendors

Once core embedded iPaaS capabilities become commoditized across countless vendors, closed source platforms without a wide strategic moat will hit walls competing against open source alternatives like Nango and Poozle.

When basic integration features are widely available, developer mindshare will shift to open tools offering greater transparency, freedom, and community-driven extensibility.

Key differentiators open source embedded iPaaS options will have:

 Code Transparency - Open code builds developer trust that there are no "secrets." Closed source cannot match this.

* Developer Freedom - Open source allows full customization and tinkering since the code is editable. Closed platforms restrict this.

* Faster Innovation - Thousands of open contributors quickly build new features. Closed source innovation velocity is far lower.

* Flexible Ecosystem - Open source enables connecting diverse services and data. Closed source inhibits this.

* Better Economics - Open platforms cost less to run and scale. Vendor fees and lock-in are avoided.

Once basic integration functions become table stakes, closed vendors will lose leverage over customers. Open platforms will pull ahead by empowering developers instead of constraining them.

### The Verdict - Bet on Open Source Long Term

In summary, organizations currently invested in closed source embedded iPaaS should evaluate leading open options like [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) and [Poozle](https://www.poozle.dev) to avoid the pitfalls of proprietary lock-in.

While tool diversity is positive for now, open source will become the ultimate winner in embedded iPaaS as the market matures. Open principles align best with developer goals around composable technology.

Forward-looking engineering teams should pilot open source platforms like Nango and Poozle to stay ahead of the innovation curve as the space evolves.

Building integrations and connecting data will only become more table-stakes over time. So maximizing transparency, customization, and collaborative development through open source embedded iPaaS will serve adopters best in the long run.
