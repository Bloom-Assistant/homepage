For many SaaS applications, the ability to support bi-directional data syncing with various third-party APIs is a crucial element for competing in a fast-paced ecosystem. From a CRM that needs to sync analytics from a mailing service, to a community platform that needs to check the status of Github PRs, the demand for integration is there.

The blocker that comes up, however, is that many organizations only have so much time and capital to devote to adding new integrations to their roadmap. When these things begin to stand in the way of progress, what can an organization do to keep moving forward at a decent pace? 

## The Rise of the Unified API 

In the past couple years, a new trend has emerged in how we manage third-party APIs and integrations as a whole. While in the past, people would rely on organizations like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to connect various data sources, there was no bidirectional syncing of data. The need for two-way syncing becomes apparent when a team or organization is building anything more than a business automation.

When building an API integration, data needs to be synced for both your customer, and on the servers of third-party. This is where Unified APIs come in, as a layer between the originating host and the third-party API. With tools like [Nango (YC W23)](https://www.nango.dev) and [Poozle (YC S23)](https://www.poozle.dev), organizations can leverage standardized formatted for integrating with third-party APIs, and pre-made templates for many services out-of-the-box. 

 Being open source projects, Nango and Poozle allow startups to stand up their own instances on their infrastructure ([Or hire us ðŸ˜Ž](https://www.tryuppercut.com/)), and connect over 70 third-party services to their product in less than a month. This allow massive cost savings by forgoing the monthly fees of other, cloud-hosted only, Unified API tools such as [Merge](https://www.linkedin.com/company/merge-api/) or [Apideck](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apideck/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BvNTDkiEKTDStrtbyckeFPg%3D%3D).

But the real beauty of Unified API's is a bit of a hidden feature. 

## Rocket fuel for tech partnerships ðŸš€ 

So you've added a whopping 70+ new integrations to your app, and you're super hyped to show off your roadmap progress. It's time to run some Google Ads right? Wrong. One of the amazing things about the sheer scale of what OSS Unified API tools enable, is the ability to scale tech partnerships by at least 40%.

One of the hardest parts about growing a large amount of tech partners, is the ability to grow a large gallery of integrations to fuel tech partnerships. With Unified APIs, this time commitment gets sawed in half, and you can put your focus into growing the relationships that matter for fruitful partnerships. 

## Connect over 100+ premade integrations 

Both [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) and [Poozle](https://www.poozle.dev) support the ability to connect over 100 pre-made integrations for bi-directional syncing. From accounting tools, banking and finance platforms, and more, there is a massively growing platform of pre-configured API integrations.

On top of this, adding new connections only takes a bit of effort, and [we can help](https://meetings.hubspot.com/james-bohrman) with any custom integrations you need help with.
