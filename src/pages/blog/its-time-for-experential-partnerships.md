I can tell you the number one reason that partners churn out. But before I do that, let's think about what the phrase "partner experience" means to you...does it mean what PRM your organizations uses? Does it mean your commission payout structure? Or is it more than that? The definition of experience according to Oxford is "an event or occurrence that leaves an impression on someone."

So on a micro scale, what PRM your organization uses can have an effect on the overall partner experience, but that isn't the whole picture. When defining what a partner experience is on a macro scale, we need to think about the things we do through the whole partner lifecycle that leave impressions on partners. 


When we leave impressions on our partners, we create experiences, and reduce that potential for partner churn. It's time for experiential partner relationships.

## Why experiences matter

When your partners think about the multiple organizations they might collaborate with they could have similar functionality, the experience you provide to them is going to be a big deciding factor on if your solution is brought to the to, or if it's a different solution that gets mentioned in your partners sales meetings. 

The experience you provide to a partner is the impression they have about your organization, and overall how you make their team feel when working with you as an organization. So it's important to provide opportunities to connect outside of one-off onboarding emails. 

### How to host an impressionable partner experience

The key to hosting an impressional partner experience is consistently providing opportunities to reinforce why working with your company is beneficial for partners. When they feel supported, enabled, and valued, they will be much less likely to explore greener pastures. It's worth investing in the relationship.

Here are some ideas on how to create great partner experiences:

- Host regular touchpoint calls or meetings to check in on the health of the partnership. This shows you care about more than just revenue numbers.

- Create opportunities for your team to connect with partner teams, such as happy hours, dinners, or team building activities when possible. The personal connections will strengthen the working relationship.

- Recognize and celebrate partner successes, wins, promotions etc. Public recognition reinforces positive impressions.

- Survey partners regularly on the health of the relationship and act on feedback. The follow-up shows you listen.

How are you making sure your partner interactions leave great impressions? What other ways could you strengthen engagement across the partner lifecycle? The experiences you cultivate will directly impact retention and growth.

### Measuring the health of partner experiences

In [our previous post](https://www.tryuppercut.com/blog/quantifying-the-partner-experience), we discussed the need for measuring the health of partner experiences. It's important to always try to have a bead on the overall health of a partner relationship, but let's look at some pracical ways to do this again. There are a few key metrics to track:

- Partner satisfaction score - via regular surveys, this measures how happy partners are with the relationship. Look for trends.

- Partner retention rate - what percentage of partners are renewing contracts each year? Declines may indicate issues.

- Revenue from partner-sourced deals - are partners bringing you business? More success means happier partners.

- Partner referrals - existing partners who refer new ones show faith in the relationship.

Regularly analyzing both quantitative data and qualitative feedback will provide insights into the overall health of your partner program. You can then course correct quickly if any aspects need improvement.

Listening to partners and acting on their input is critical for experiences that delight rather than disappoint. With robust analytics and a customer-centric culture, you can build partner loyalty that withstands competition.
