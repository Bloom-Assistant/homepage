Remember how the term "simp" used to be used in a negative connotation? It's always been crazy to me that gassing someone up can ever be seen as a bad thing, but the more I participate in the partnerships ecosystem the more I realize that I kinda love the term and how much it fits (albeit in a humorous way) with concepts that groups like [Sparktoro](https://sparktoro.com/blog/the-case-for-permissionless-co-marketing/) and [Nearbound](https://nearbound.com/) are diving into. 

As a ecosystem, we should always be lifting each other up, no matter our ICP or sector. There is so much to learn from each other and gain from the various experiences that it 100% pays to be a simp.
