Everyone wants a positive experience when they interact with their peers, clients, and partners. That is pretty much a universal truth not only in business, but in our everyday lives as well. Today, the client experience is front and center in most SaaS companies strategic vision, with platforms like ChurnZero raising $25m to help organizations measure and improve their customer success goals. 

Yet today, the **partner experience** (or PX) is treated largely as an afterthought. Even with experts urging heavily against this, it’s become all too common for organizations to implement partnership programs that exist merely as a place for partners to submit referrals and not a collaborative experience to engage partner stakeholders in at multiple levels. The lack of any sort of experiential approach makes it difficult to identify conflicts in partner/vendor relationships and creates opportunities for eventual churn.

## Taking a page from the customer success playbook

So how do we quantify the partner experience? One of the main goals of any customer success (CX) motion is to reduce churn rates and increase retention. It’s crucial to any SaaS company that relies on recurring revenue to keep their lights on. When customer success teams try to get a feel for their clients overall experience, they run surveys such as CSAT and NPS assessments. 

This is an area that has become an afterthought to many leadership teams that plan the overall strategic vision for their partner programs. Many organizations will prioritize the client experience, while neglecting the partners who may have originally brought those clients into the fold into the first place. 

When an organization is bringing in anything more than 10% of their new business from partners, then it is crucial that they begin to prioritize the experience of those partners so that they do not churn out of the program. Churn from partners can be just as detrimental to an organization’s bottom line as churn from clients, especially if a large portion of new business is coming from partnerships. 

So it is crucial to make sure that your partners have the best experience possible by always assessing their needs and goals when planning your partner strategy. 

## The Partner Experience survey

The key to quantifying any partner experience is always going to be asking the right questions, and turning that data into a holistic metric. I’ve identified a few key items that go into my PX surveys, but you may have different needs than I do, so feel free to copy the Airtable I’m going to link at the end of this post and edit to your heart's desire.
