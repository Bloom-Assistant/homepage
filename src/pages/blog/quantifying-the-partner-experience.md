Everyone wants a positive experience when they interact with their peers, clients, and partners. That is pretty much a universal truth not only in business, but in our everyday lives as well. Today, the client experience is front and center in most SaaS companies strategic vision, with platforms like ChurnZero raising $25m to help organizations measure and improve their customer success goals. 

Yet today, the **partner experience** (or PX) is treated largely as an afterthought. Even with experts urging heavily against this, it’s become all too common for organizations to implement partnership programs that exist merely as a place for partners to submit referrals and not a collaborative experience to engage partner stakeholders in at multiple levels. The lack of any sort of experiential approach makes it difficult to identify conflicts in partner/vendor relationships and creates opportunities for eventual churn.

## Taking a page from the customer success playbook

So how do we quantify the partner experience? One of the main goals of any customer success (CX) motion is to reduce churn rates and increase retention. It’s crucial to any SaaS company that relies on recurring revenue to keep their lights on. When customer success teams try to get a feel for their clients overall experience, they run surveys such as CSAT and NPS assessments. 

This is an area that has become an afterthought to many leadership teams that plan the overall strategic vision for their partner programs. Many organizations will prioritize the client experience, while neglecting the partners who may have originally brought those clients into the fold into the first place. 

When an organization is bringing in anything more than 10% of their new business from partners, then it is crucial that they begin to prioritize the experience of those partners so that they do not churn out of the program. Churn from partners can be just as detrimental to an organization’s bottom line as churn from clients, especially if a large portion of new business is coming from partnerships. 

So it is crucial to make sure that your partners have the best experience possible by always assessing their needs and goals when planning your partner strategy. 

## The Partner Experience survey

The key to quantifying any partner experience is always going to be asking the right questions, and turning that data into a holistic metric. I’ve identified a few key items that go into my PX surveys, but you may have different needs than I do, so feel free to copy the Airtable I’m going to link at the end of this post and edit to your heart's desire. 

- **Collaboration Score:** Rating (1-10)
    - Example Question:  *How happy are you with the provided collaboration opportunities?*
- **Onboarding Score:** Rating (1-10)
    - Example Question: *How happy are you with the on-boarding process?*
- **Engagement Score:** Rating (1-10)
    - Example Question: *How engaged do you feel as a partner of our company?*
- **Technology Trust:** Yes/No
    Example Question: *Do you feel like our company’s solution does what it claims to do?*
- **Cohesion:** Yes/No
    Example Question: *Do you feel like there is decent cohesion between partners of Uppercut and their goals?*
- **Education Score:** Rating (1-10)
    Example Question: *How educated does your team feel when talking about Uppercut's product?*
- **Churn Score:**: Rating (1-10)
    Example Question: *How likely are you to remain a partner for the next two years?*
- **General Happiness:** Rating (1-10)
    Example Question: *In a general sense, how happy have you been as a partner of Uppercut?*

This isn’t an all encompassing list of questions, and you are free to edit it however you choose, but in a general sense this is a starting point for measuring your partner experience. 

## How to act on PX metrics

Quantifying your PX metrics is only the first step to providing a decent partner experience. To really act on the data you’ve received, you need to make relevant changes to your partner operations so that you’re providing the best possible partner experience. 

As an example, say you get a 6 out of 10 on your onboarding. That’s not a terrible number, but it means some improvements can be made to your onboarding process. One of the things I always like to suggest for partner teams of at least three is using partner experience platforms such as [Superglue](https://www.superglue.io) to automate your onboarding and other operational processes.

One of the awesome services we provide here at Uppercut is the setup and management of tools like Superglue as part of our Partner Operations services. If that sounds interesting to you, let’s set up a [time to chat here](https://www.tryuppercut.com/consultation).

## What will the future of PX look like?

The future of partner experiences is looking bright, with more and more people starting to talk about changing habits daily. Companies are realizing that they can’t just set up a partner portal with no extra work and expect leads to just flow into their pipeline. 

As far as where this is going, I’m working on a newsletter diving into Uppercut’s Top 10 predictions for the Partner Experience industry that will be sent out next week. If you’d like to get sign up for this exclusive resource, [head over to this page](https://website-55786.convertflowpages.com/newsletter) to get notified when it drops. 

But I'll wet your whistle a bit by stating my biggest prediction for practice of partner experience is that I think we will see a ChurnZero analogue for partnerships very soon. Partner programs need a way to not only operate, but measure their vendors experience and overall happiness to reduce churn and keep retention steady. 

Lastly, I promised you an exclusive Partner Experience survey template that you can use to gauge your own partner experience levels, and I’ll close off this post by providing you with the link to the Airtable base [here](https://airtable.com/appelZKAiDemRDSyl/shrYcD6xVxvBA1VO0)!
