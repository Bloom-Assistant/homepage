        title: 'Why would I not just use Slack?',
        description:
          "We aren't trying to compete with Slack for starters. But the simple answer to this is that our tool is built especially for GTM professionals and partnership teams to facilitate cross organizational collaboration, where Slack requires a restrictive Pro subscription to take advantage of cross-organizational collaboration to it's full extent. This can often cost tens of thousands of dollars at large organizations, where our base collaboration package will only require a monthly subscription of $350",
      },
      {
        title: 'Why is realtime collaboration important?',
        description:
          "We believe that the power of tools like Slack lies in the ability to send a message while it is top of mind, and get a reply at the earliest possible convenience. This is a missing piece in PRMs today.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How does this compare to tools like PartnerStack?',
        description:
          'PartnerStack and other PRM tools are great if you have a low-activity partnership program and are looking for a way to track revenue. But if you are looking to build a high-velocity partnership program that engages your partners frequently, you need a tool that enables you to collaborate with your partners in real-time.',

        title: 'What integrations do you support for account mapping?',

      },
      {
        title: "What's your pricing model?",

        title: 'How do you handle security?',

          "We use WebAuthn to handle passwordless auth, but we also plan to support enterprise SSO in the near future. All of our data is encrypted at the application level and we use a variety of security tools to ensure that our application is secure.
