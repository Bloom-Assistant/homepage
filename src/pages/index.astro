        title: 'Why would I not just use Slack?',
        description:
          "We aren't trying to compete with Slack for starters. But the simple answer to this is that our tool is build especially for GTM professionals and partnership teams to facilitate cross organizational collaboration, where Slack requires a restrictive Pro subscription to take advantage of cross-organizational collaboration to it's full extent. This can often cost tens of thousands of dollars at large organizations, where our base collaboration package will only require a monthly subscription of $350",

        title: 'Why is realtime collaboration important?',

      },
      {
        title: 'How does this compare to tools like PartnerStack?',
        description:
          'PartnerStack and other PRM tools are great if you have a low-activity partnership program and are looking for a way to track revenue. But if you are looking to build a high-velocity partnership program that engages your partners frequently, you need a tool that enables you to collaborate with your partners in real-time.',

All of our data is encrypted at the application level and we use a variety of security tools to ensure that our application is secure.
