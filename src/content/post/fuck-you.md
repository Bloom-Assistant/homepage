So before I kick off this shitshow, I want to be clear...if you've engaged with me in a positive way in the past 3 months, or are someone who contributes to my work, or work adjacent to the work I do (Silent supporters are valid also), then you're not included in anything I'm about to say. 

The rest of you, fuck you. 

![Alt text](https://media.tenor.com/HWBMmc8g6p4AAAAC/fuck-fuck-you.gif)

Over the past three months, I've seen more horrific human rights abuses committed on women and children than I thought I would ever see in my life. I've watched children scream in pain while a doctor amputates their leg because it was destroyed due to white phosporus burns (a war crime btw). I've learned about the acronym that shouldn't exist called WCNSF, or "wounded child, no surviving family". 

I've watched as people tried to justify and make excuses to the many war crimes committed by the apartheid state, such as my ex-friend Edwin Gustavo, (Look him up on Linkedin and say hi 🙂) arguing about the technicalities of the Al-Ahli hospital bombing only for Israel's bombing to knock out a [total of 31 ambulances and 20 hospitals](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/bloodbath-israel-keeps-hitting-gaza-hospitals-amid-international-uproar).

Of course the typical argument for this is "Oh but Hamas use civilians as human shields 🤓", which I first of all, ask you for evidence of, and second of all ask you why if it's wrong for Hamas to do so, and invalidates the lives of civilians, then why [is it ok for Israel to do so?](https://www.btselem.org/topic/human_shields)

There's something deep in the core of the American psyche that makes them unable to think rationally when it comes to the illegal state of Israel. Most Americans will argue until they are blue in the face that Israel has a right to exist, but many don't even know who Yasser Arafat is and if they do, they absolutely don't know anything about the [bloody history and displacement that led up to Israel controlling the land they do today](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/5/23/the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948). If you asked the average American what the Nakba was, like I did Eddie, they would look at you like you had three heads. 

### It's time to wake the fuck up

We can only avoid what is happening for so long, because it directly involves us. Every 2,000-pound MK-84 that gets dropped on a family just trying to survive, creating a 9yo amputee and a WCNSF is directly funded by american tax dollars. So we can whine and cry about how it doesn't affect us all day, but it does. So the more I see people silent about these issues while posting pictures of little Timothy's baseball game, the more it fills be with a burning rage at the hypocrisy of the West.

Oh but of course can say they are trying to keep civilian casualties low, and you'll eat it up hook like and sinker, even though the amount of Gaza's daily deaths [are outpacing any other armed conflict in previous years](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/gaza-daily-deaths-exceed-all-other-major-conflicts-in-21st-century-oxfam) while there have been over 500 instances of incitement to genocide by members of leadership in the Knesset, army personnel, and intellectuals.

And this isn't just hearsay, a outlier but [elected member of the Knesset himself has experienced enough that he has thrown his weight into South Africa's genocide claim](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/13/1224635827/israeli-lawmaker-on-the-u-n-genocide-case-against-israel), which signals something is amiss in the West's propesity to shrug off the idea. 

### "Well if Hamas didn't...."

Shut the fuck up. Hamas didn't just wake up and magically decide that Israel is the enemy, and this didn't start on October 7th. This has been an ongoing struggle for the [people of Palestine (formerly Jaffa) since 1948](https://electronicintifada.net/content/jaffa-eminence-ethnic-cleansing/8088).

I was speaking with a journalist who is on the ground in Gaza just today about the conflict, and mind you this is a person who has lost a tremendous about and still has the potential to lost more and he said:

> Imagine if a person was in need of help one day, and this person did not have anything, no money, no food, no drink, and then he came asking for help and you, as a human being, helped and gave him everything. In your home, you provided him with food, drink, and clothes, and provided him with a job to live on, and suddenly, this person whom you helped turns against you, and wants to kill you, destroy your home, and take it from you, and wants to expel you from your land, steal your money, kill your children, and do everything that no human being can imagine. This is what has been happening to our people since 1940.

So as an American, with all of our collective independence and **freedom*, would you leave your house, your money, your parents, and your clothes? No the fuck you would not. But you've never thought about it that deeply have you? It's just easy to side with the Israeli people like it was for Eddy, because there will always be that kneejerk reaction to support Israel as ["the only democracy in the middle east"](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231219-israel-has-arrested-46-journalists-since-7-october-says-prisoners-rights-group/) that has arrested [over 38 journalists](https://www.commondreams.org/news/israel-detains-journalists). 

Because at the end of the day, it doesn't really effect you, you're able to go to work and relax knowing the brown people are bad and the white people are good. You don't really care if people are [getting kicked out of there generational homes by settlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqozQ8uaV8) on live broadcast, because it **won't happen to you**. 

For the rest of you, please keep the fight going...there are good people in the world ready to put in the work it takes to see a brighter future for the people of Palestine. I started Oasis as a way to support my efforts in both writing content and to provide stories that educate others about issues that are creating suffering in not only Gaza, but all across the globe. So if you like my content, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/getoasis) to help me continue this work. Also if you're a company who would like to sponsor Oasis, whether publicly or anonymously, [shoot me an email](james@getoasis.io) and let's discuss our packages. As always, from the river to the sea, palestine will be free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸.
