Every person in the US has an idealized idea of what fighting for freedom is.

Even most soldiers are simply fighting to further the successes of corporate interests. 

So what does freedom mean? What does it mean to fight for your freedom when you're born into a system where you already have it to begin with? One of the places I always look, are the sections of society that don't have those freedoms we take for granted. See, we like to demonize groups like Hamas for expressing their internationally recognized [right to resist](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/7/20/palestinians-have-a-legal-right-to-armed-struggle) in any way possible, but we've never even been in a situation where we have had to resist an occupier. 

We idealize the scenario where we have to fight for our freedoms, but there are teenage girls in the West Bank with more traits in common with our founding fathers than the average conservative 30yo who whinges about freedom. In fact, a good example of this is BBC's coverage of [Ahed Tamimi's slap of an IOF soldier in 2018](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-42884885). The simple fact that anyone is asking whether her action made her terrorist or not shows how mentally fucking warped the West has become...
