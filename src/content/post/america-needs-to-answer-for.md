**WARNING: THIS FOLLOWING BLOG POST CONTAINS VERY GRAPHIC IMAGERY. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**

If you subscribe to any sort of anarchist form philosophy like I do and live in the west, you've without a doubt been subjected to this critisism of anarchist logic by middle aged white men who love to quote Ayn Rand that goes something like:

> Well if we didn't have governments and laws then everything would be chaos

This argument always puts a bit of a smile on my face, because it's often thrown out there as a kneejerk reaction from guys who have never had to actually [fight for their freedoms, or even had them threatened](/true-americans-support-gazan-freedom), but love to talk about their love of the founding fathers till they go blue in the face. In the west, we love to romanticize the idea of freedom fighting, but we label people who fight for their freedom as terrorists. 

It's one of the outcomes of being isolated from the volatility of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, but it begs the question as to whether our comfortability has turned into complacency, in a world where men and women aren't forced to worry about outside forces affecting their freedom or safety, has it become easy for us to look away from the suffering of others?

For example, the stories coming out of Gaza are more and more horrific every time I open my phone. From [summary executions](https://www.aljazeera.com/program/newsfeed/2024/1/18/video-shows-aftermath-of-a-summary-execution-of-15-men-in-a-gaza-apartment) to [child starvation](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2442861/middle-east), this event has truly made a mockery out of anyone who considers the west as a bastion of freedom and human rights. It kindof feels like chaos is already here?

We as a nation have become experts at milking every last cent from taxpayers for the weapons to wage proxy battles in places many of our citizens can't even locate on a map. 

### It's liberty or death. It's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody

Israel has been militarily and illegally occupying the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem (including the Old City), and the Gaza Strip, as well as the Syrian Golan Heights since 1967. In the West Bank, Israel has instituted a dual system of laws for Jewish settlers and Palestinians. [Jewish settlers are governed by the laws of Israel and are accorded the full rights of Israeli citizenship, including the right to vote, while Palestinians are ruled by Israeli military decree.](http://www.hrw.org/node/95061)

> "Palestinians face systematic discrimination merely because of their race, ethnicity, and national origin, depriving them of electricity, water, schools, and access to roads, while nearby Jewish settlers enjoy all of these state-provided benefitsâ€¦ While Israeli settlements flourish, Palestinians under Israeli control live in a time warp - not just separate, not just unequal, but sometimes even pushed off their lands and out of their homes."

In fact, Israel's cruel form of apartheid controls not only the flow of goods, but the electricity and water that flows into Gaza as well. This effectively allows Israel to distribute over 4x as much water to illegal settlers on Palestinian land than to the Palestinian people themselves.

But here in the states, we're perfectly happy with allowing Israel to suckle from the tit of the US taxpayers as we sent them weapons to [kill two mothers every hour](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/1/20/israels-war-on-gaza-live-israel-denied-70-of-aid-to-north-gaza-says-un). That's not freedom, it's lipstick in a motherfucking red, white, and blue pig.   

### We have exported terror while we label our enemies as terrorists

My state is full of self-professed freedom-lovers, and I myself am a rabid believer in personal freedom and self-determination. The problem is as Malcolm X said, it's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody. We can't strive to be a nation who claims to believe in the ideals of freedom while providing the weapons and funding for an ally to do what Israel has been doing to Gaza. 

The average American will probably never have to worry about escaping from [white phosphorus](https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20090111__MIDEAST-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANSCp1.jpg?w=600), or [holding their dying child in their arms](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article3915063.ece/ALTERNATES/n615/Gaza-Main.jpg). The average American will never have to worry about going through what Asmaa Al-Durra is going through.

![](~/assets/images/asmaa.jpeg)

Asmaa is a Palestinian living in the Nuseirat camp for refugees in the central Gaza Strip (360 kilometers from east to west and from north to south). Every member of her family has been killed except for her and some of her children. Her house was demolished above her head, and she survived, but she lost her eye, and the other eye is about to lose her if she is not treated immediately.

The problem is that Israel controls all aid in and out of Gaza and getting adequate treatment in these conditions is incredibly difficult. The average American will **never** have to experience something like this. Yet we feel justified in labeling Hamas as terrorists when they were elected based on both their social programs and the ability to resist the illegal occupation of Israel's apartheid regime. 

Frankly, I call bullshit to that. If you've never been in a position where you are:

- Given different rights as others
- Subjected to military occupation
- Forced from your homeland

You don't get to label anyone who is trying to assert their [legally protected right to resistance](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/7/20/palestinians-have-a-legal-right-to-armed-struggle) their homeland as a terrorist. Especically when our biggest export is terror.
