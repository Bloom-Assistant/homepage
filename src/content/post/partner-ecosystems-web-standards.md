With the depreciation of third-party cookies and technologies like fingerprinting under increased scrutiny, marketers and advertisers are having to completely rework how they go about gathering key info about their audience and tracking attributable events. Even industries that largely have a high degree of trust involved have been affected by browsers doing away with third-party cookies and opting for a first-party cookie experience alltogether. 


However, this leaves a gap in feasibility for a concept that has been discussed in theory but never truly existed in practice. The potential of **second-party** data has long been talked about from a marketing perspective, although in reality there hasn't been a technical implementation of the concept. There is a lot of marketing definitions about what makes up second-party data, but there is no concensus over whether it is actually a real concept. 

## What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small string of text that a website stores on a user's computer or device. This data is sent back and forth between the user's web browser and the web server, providing a way for the website to recognize and remember the user. Cookies are commonly used to provide a personalized browsing experience and to store information such as user preferences, login information, and items in a shopping cart. Despite public mistrust, even third-party cookies can have positive uses when used **responsibly** and **consensually** such as:

- **Session management:** Cookies can be used to manage user sessions, allowing websites to recognize users as they navigate different pages on a site.

- **Personalization:** Websites can use cookies to remember user preferences and settings, providing a more customized browsing experience.

- **Tracking:** Cookies can track user behavior and activities on a website, helping website owners analyze user interactions and improve their services.

- **Advertising:** Cookies are often used for targeted advertising, allowing advertisers to deliver more relevant ads based on a user's browsing history and preferences.

## Why don't people trust cookies?

The overall mistrust of cookies is largely a creation of corporations mishandling the data and trust that was given to them by their users. Over the years, scandal after scandal have reared their head with policy shaking events such as [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica) making the public increasingly wary of of their online footprint. 

So the mistrust of cookies is understandable, but that leaves marketers in a difficult spot in an industry that powers a huge portion of the nations economy. 

### A History of Data Privacy

So where did this all start? Let's take a look at the history of privacy, and how we went from King William the Conquerer ordering the first survey of England in the Domesday book, to expansive identity based tracking. 

#### Pre 1960s: The Origin of Statistics

The origin of statistics can largely be tracked to the first surveys done by King William the Conquerer. The Domesday Book is one of the most famous and comprehensive land surveys in medieval history. William commissioned this extensive survey to assess the land and assets of England and to aid in the effective administration of his newly conquered kingdom.

The purpose of the Domesday Book was primarily to record the wealth and value of the land, as well as the resources and livestock held by the kingdom. It was also designed to help William in determining the extent of taxation he could impose on the land and people. The compilation of this book was a massive undertaking and involved surveying the majority of England.

The Domesday Book provided a detailed record of the landholdings and resources of England, including information on landowners, tenants, and the value of the land. It was a comprehensive account of the economic resources of the country at that time, helping in the efficient collection of taxes and enabling the central administration to assert control over the vast territory. 

#### 1960s-1990s: The Early Days of Collection

Fast forward to the 1960s, and the early data of data collection on US citizens is beginning to take shape. The early collections on US citizens was still in its nascent stages, with technology playing a limited role compared to contemporary times. However, there were several developments during this era that set the stage for the extensive data collection and surveillance practices seen in later decades.

The decade also witnessed the emergence of early computer systems, although they were not as advanced as the technologies available today. These systems were primarily used for scientific and military purposes, and their application in data collection and surveillance was still relatively limited. In 1991, the internet went public for the first time, with the emergence of cookies and SSL following three years after in 1994.

#### 2000s: The era of expansion

The early 2000s were the nascent stages of the internet. With the rise of online commerce and communication, issues like credit card fraud became more prevalent, prompting the need for improved security measures and regulations. Google AdWords, launched in 2000, revolutionized online advertising by allowing businesses to create targeted advertisements and reach their intended audience more effectively. This platform has since evolved into Google Ads, becoming an essential tool for businesses to promote their products and services on the internet.

The tragic events of September 11, 2001, notably impacted global politics, security measures, and surveillance practices. The United States, in particular, implemented various measures aimed at enhancing national security, leading to increased government surveillance efforts.

The 2000s also witnessed the rapid growth of social media platforms, such as Facebook, which was launched in 2004. These platforms not only transformed the way people communicate and share information but also raised concerns about data privacy and the potential misuse of personal information.

#### 2010s: The Turning Point

he 2010s were marked by several high-profile data breaches that significantly impacted various sectors and industries. Some of the notable data breaches during this period included:

- **Yahoo:** In 2013, Yahoo experienced a massive data breach that affected over 3 billion accounts. This breach compromised sensitive personal information, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and encrypted passwords.

- **Equifax:** In 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit bureaus in the US, suffered a significant data breach that exposed the personal information of approximately 147 million consumers. This breach included sensitive data such as Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers.

- **eBay:** In 2014, eBay experienced a cyber attack that compromised the personal information of 145 million users. The breach exposed encrypted passwords and other sensitive data, leading to concerns about user privacy and security.

These breaches, among others, raised serious concerns about data security, privacy, and the need for stronger cybersecurity measures. They also prompted discussions about the importance of implementing robust data protection strategies and the significance of maintaining customer trust in the digital age.

Then, in 2018, GDPR was implemented in the European Union (EU), significantly transforming the landscape of data protection and privacy not only within the EU but also impacting global businesses operating within the EU market. The implementation of GDPR not only aimed to strengthen data protection and privacy rights for individuals but also sought to create a unified regulatory environment for data protection within the EU.

#### 2021+: The Future of Privacy

Now, we're beginning to think about what the future of privacy will look like, as Google delays it's transition to a cookieless future (2021) and implements it's Privacy Sandbox, while Apple adds it's new App Tracking Transparency (2021). Given the developments at Google and Apple, it is evident that the future of privacy will be shaped by a dynamic interplay of technological advancements, regulatory interventions, and user-centric approaches. While Google's Privacy Sandbox represents a potential shift towards more privacy-friendly advertising practices, the delay in transitioning to a cookieless future underscores the complexities of overhauling entrenched data collection methods.

### Companies abused the trust they were given

So what does this all mean? It means that companies over time have lost the [trust](https://nearbound.com/resources/nearbound-marketing-a-trust-driven-path-in-the-who-economy) of the average website visitor. And when you lose the trust of people, then everything begins to fall apart. According to a Search Engine Land Survey, roughly 60% of consumers [are *open* to allowing tracking](https://searchengineland.com/apple-idfa-consent-roughly-60-of-consumers-open-to-persuasion-to-allow-tracking-340390). This is an interesting sign to me, that the average user does not *mind* being tracked, but they aren't going to allow you to track them without trust. 

Which makes sense when you break it down. Because think about it, would you let a total stranger follow you around while you shopped all day? Of course not. But would you let your friend, who has put in the time to get to know you follow you around while you shopped? Chances are you'd be more open to it. 

## What does a world without cookies mean for partner marketers?

As the internet transitions to a cookieless future, many people [like us](https://www.tryuppercut.com/platform/resin) are stuck figuring out how they can share data effectively across multiple domain, the make data partnerships really work. My ideal ecosystem, my partnership Nirvana you might say, is a state where I can create a partnership with three promising companies, and once they accept we all have seamless insights into attributable intent events across the ecosystem. 

But in a totally cookieless society, this is almost impossible without some questionable workarounds. So we're left with questions about what partnership marketing and attribution looks like in a cookieless future. 

## What is second-party data?

A term that has seen a lot of talk is [second-party data](https://insider.crossbeam.com/resources/the-era-of-second-party-data-is-here-are-you-ready). The term seems to have a fair bit of controversy, and we'll dive into that in a bit, but I want to start by saying I love the idea of second-party data (or **partner data**) as a concept. Second-party data is data that you share and receive from partners. When you share data with your partners, that is second-party data.

### Both a concept, and a potential solution

There's a bit of marketing miscommunication around second-party data, as seen in this [Stack Overflow conversation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71325236/regarding-third-party-cookies-who-is-a-second-party). Second-party data is both a concept, that in my opinion might be ahead of it's time by just a little bit. See, the concept of second-party data is firm, and could work great, but for it to exist in a cross-domain context with data partnerships, there would have to be some small chhanges in fundamental web standards.  

Much of the marketing done on the topic of second-party cookies has been discussed in a high-level concept, without much concern for implementation details and technical requirements. In one sense, second-party cookies mean **cross-domain** cookies, which are often just referred to as **third-party cookies**, and as we've discussed, are getting phased out in the majority of browsers. 

But this doesn't have to be the case, as second-party cookies don't have to just be an obscure concept left to the abyss of ideas thought up by marketers.

## For second-party to work in practice, we need new web standards

For a concept like second-party cookies to work as a solution, we need to rethink how we frame privacy, trust, and concept. Going back to my earlier analogy about who you would trust to follow you around the store, I believe that the majority of users would be more than happy to allow their **ecosystem** to track their activity if they had their **trust**. But without that important component, it's an uphill battle to let anyone follow you around a store. 

### Our proposed implementation of "Ecosystem Sets"

We've come up with an interesting proposal for ecosystem cookies, that implements a new standard similar to the [WICG's Related Website Sets](https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets), but for the purpose of consensual tracking of users in an ecosystem. Our proposal aims to bring trust back into the marketing world, while giving users the choice to trust their ecosystem with their information should the ecosystem have gained it. 

### Define boundaries for multi-domain data sharing

Our planned proposal will allow partnered domains to act as their own central authority for connected domains, and define boundaries for data sharing across multiple domains. This will allow minimal "ecosystem cookies" to be shared cross-domain, with set boundaries declared. So for example, say you are the partner manager at `hooli.com`. With our proposed implementation of Ecosytem Sets, you could add a relation to `piedpiper.com`. Then, after provide a each other a verification key and implementing the relationships, you would now be able to support cross domain cookies from `hoolie.com` and `piedpiper.com` 

### Similar to the WICG's Related Website Sets

This proposal is very similar to the WICG's Related Website Sets, but we deviate in our stated goals mainly in that Ecosystem Sets explicitly focuses on the goal of cross-domain tracking where Related Website Sets does not have that as it's given goal. Ecosystem Sets largely would enable the next generation of partner-led tools, and even more trust-enabled advertising as a whole.  

The major enabler to Ecosystem Sets is consent. With roughly 60% of consumers stating they are open to being tracked, marketers, regulators, and standardization bodies need to find a middle ground that enables everyone to be happy. 

## Uppercut's plans to become involved with the W3C

So with all of that said, we have decided to get involved with the W3C's WICG working group as much as possible, and work to establish new ways for those of you building partner tools to take advantage of the best the web has to offer. Our first order of business obviously will be submitting this proposal, and then who knows what will happen. Want to get involved yourself? We're on WhatsApp!
