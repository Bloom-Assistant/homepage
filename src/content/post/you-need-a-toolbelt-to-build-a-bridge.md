How does one solve the problem of chaotic and inefficient partnership programs? That‚Äôs something I‚Äôm going to be diving heavily into over the next month or so, and believe very strongly about, because at the end of the day, we all want that sweet effervescent nectar of partner-sourced leads that we all strive for when running programs.

A common problem I see in a lot of programs is that there is a huge segment of companies that think that setting up a reseller portal with a link in their homepage‚Äôs footer that sits and collects dust while not putting in any work to build the relationships or enable the partners who sign up is all they need to do to generate partnership revenue. 

The problem is half an education issue, and half a tooling issue. Today I‚Äôm going to dive into the tooling aspect. An interesting allegory that I hear a lot from other Partner Managers is the ‚Äúbuilding bridges‚Äù concept, where the role of partnerships is likened to a bridge between two organizations to provide mutual value. 

## The stack determines your partners experience

When a bridge or any other structural item is being built, the tools and architectural patterns chosen determine the effectiveness and oftentimes safety of what is being built. Of course, there aren‚Äôt lives on the line in your day to day B2B partner dynamic, but any partner manager knows that the tools you choose to architect your partner program, play a massive role in your partner experience. 

Creating a cohesive partnership experience facilitates faster mutual TTV and enables partners to help themselves, and in some cases, as with many of the programs Uppercut has brainstormed, help each other. The right tools and framework enable partners to find resources, collaborate, and plan events, all with the goal of mutually providing value. 

## What makes a good stack?

When I‚Äôm building a partner program, I often build it in the image of what I myself would want to see as a partner, so as a super neurodivergent person there‚Äôs a lot of unique aspects I use many people haven‚Äôt explored yet. While the question of what tools should go into a partnership program are largely dependent on the organization, the end goal of enabling your partners to help themselves in their efforts to communicate the value of your products is always going to be fairly standard across the board. That said, I have a few key items I always look for when planning out a partner program. 

### Cohesive Onboarding

Arguably one of my most important requirements when exploring tooling is how will this tool affect a potential partner's first experience during our collaboration. The onboarding process is one of the most overlooked items of partner programs, and it is so important to get it right. As a partner, I want to be able to find any links, resources, and documents centralized in one location without having to move mountains. 

How we handle this at Uppercut: Dock

Although our clients can always bring their own PRM, and Dock isn't even technical a PRM, Dock has become a great tool for enabling cohesive relationships that we spun up our own use case for. 

We love the intiutive and brandable interface that allows us to personalize our partners onboarding and walk partners through evern step from first touch to the last project we do together. 

It supports some awesome features such as:

- Project timelines
- Resource sections
- Kanban board

And these features weren't even made with partners in mind

### Partner Hubs
This is a angle that a lot of partnership programs haven‚Äôt even begun to touch, but the partner hub is wildly important to me as a partner, and it‚Äôs been so powerful to use in my experiments with other groups that I think it has the potential to completely change a mediocre no-name bridge partner relationship dynamic, to a Golden Gate Bridge level relationship. 

A partner-hub can be any chat or communication tool where your partners gather to communicate and share updates and resources. The idea solution for this is an inter-organizational chat platform a la Slack Connect, but there aren‚Äôt a ton of tool options for that.

The main goal is to be able to talk with your partners as a group, for transparency and collaborative resource sharing.

## Conclusion

Just as the tools and architectural decisions influence the strength and efficacy of a physical bridge, the tools chosen for a partner program significantly impact the partner experience and overall success. Creating a cohesive partnership experience hinges on selecting the right tools and frameworks that empower partners to collaborate, access resources, and communicate value effectively.
